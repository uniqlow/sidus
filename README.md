This is a little quick-and-dirty program to read star catalogs in the Yale Bright Star binary format and convert them to a form suitable for real-time rendering.

Currently it outputs in either CSV form or as a C single-header library form star data such as right-ascension, declination, and apparent magnitude.

The Yale Bright Star Catalog edition 5 can be found at:

I thought it would handle the SKY2000 catalog as well, but something is weird with that format.
Will probably add support later when I figured it out.

Sorry, no time for more documentation here.
